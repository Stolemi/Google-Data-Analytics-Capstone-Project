# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project

## Introduction 
During the past month I have been completing  the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate offered on Coursera, mainly to get an introduction and to develop my skills with SQL and Tableau, as I already had many courses on R during my Master in Economics. This is a quick analysis based on the *Cyclist dataset.

## Background
In this case study I am assumed to be a Jr. data analyst working in the marketing analytics team at Cyclist, a bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclist started in 2016 and since then the program has grown to a fleet of almost 6000 bikes that are locked into a network of little less than 700 stations around Chicago. The company offers both classic and electric bikes and has two types of membership: *casuals*, customers who buy single-trip pass or day pass; *members*, customer who purchase an annual pass. 

## ASK 
The analysis conducted by the finance department have determined that Members are the most profitable customers and have tasked the marketing department with organizing a campaign to convert Casuals customer into Members. The marketing department therefore needs to conduct an analysis based on historical data to asses: *What are the difference between Members and Casuals and how these can be exploited in the marketing campaign.*

## PREPARE
The data is collected directly by Cyclist and for this analysis I restrict the sample to monthly data for 2022. The data is saved in 12 separated files as .csv.
