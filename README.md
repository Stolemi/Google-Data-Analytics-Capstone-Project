# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project


During the past month I have been completing  the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate offered on Coursera, mainly to get an introduction and to develop my skills with SQL and Tableau, as I already had many courses on R during my Master in Economics. This is a quick analysis based on the **Cyclist dataset**. The file [Project.md](https://github.com/Stolemi/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Project.md) contains the description of the steps taken during the analysis.
